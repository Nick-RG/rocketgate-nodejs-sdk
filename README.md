# RocketGate Node.js Gateway SDK

A JavaScript version of the RocketGate SDK

The Gateway Service communicates with servers within the RocketGate network to perform standard credit card transactions, i.e. auth-only, ticket, void, etc.

## Install 

* npm install
* mocha

## Docs
There is inline documentation below. Additional docs related to this SDK are located at:

1. GatewayService: https://help.rocketgate.com/support/solutions/articles/28000018238-gatewayservice
2. GatewayRequest: https://help.rocketgate.com/support/solutions/articles/28000018237-gatewayrequest

## Gateway Service Methods

Most methods accept `request`, `response`, and `callback` parameters.
* The `request` parameter is an object containing the information being sent to RocketGate. The `request` object is created by GatewayRequest (see below) and will always contain a `version` property.
* The `response` parameter is initially empty and eventually contains RocketGate's response to the request.
* The `callback` function returns the data to the function that called it. The callback generally includes 3 parameters:
    * `result` - boolean value indicating whether the transaction was performed successfully and accepted by the banking institution.
    * `request` - updated `request` object
    * `response` - if the `result` is true, `response` contains details including the transaction ID, auth-code, etc. If a “false” value is returned, the transaction failed and response contains an explanation of the failure.

### performAuthOnly
Submit an auth-only transaction to the RocketGate system.
* **Required GatewayRequest Parameters**
    * merchantID
    * merchantPassword
    * amount

        * if cardNo:
            * expireMonth
            * expireYear

## Subscription Examples
Following are some examples of the use of the parameters for various types of subscription actions. Note that the customer ID and original invoice ID are required to perform any modifications to a subscription.

###Initial subscription purchase
**Rebilling trial**
Scenario: User wishes to purchase a 3-day trial at $1.00. Rebills monthly at $40.00.

    request.merchantCustomerID = "cust-1";
    request.merchantInvoiceID = "invoice-1";
    request.amount = "1.00";
    request.rebillStart = "3";
    request.rebillAmount = "40.00";
    request.rebillFrequency = "MONTHLY";

###Upgrade membership

**Full/Instant Upgrade**  
Scenario: User wishes to upgrade from a $40/month membership to a $50/month membership. The example code below will upgrade membership immediately, stop the trial period and change the $40 subscription to a $50 monthly subscription. Billing begins immediately at new price. The next rebill date is set equal to today plus one month.

    request.merchantCustomerID = "cust-1";
    request.merchantInvoiceID = "invoice-1";
    request.rebillStart = "AUTO";
    request.rebillAmount = "40.00";

**Pro-rated/Instant Upgrade**  
Scenario: Trial period has limited access – user wishes to have the increased access associated with the full (non-trial) membership. End trial membership immediately and begin full (non- trial) membership. The example code below will charge pro-rated price for balance of trial period. Leave rebill price, date, and frequency unchanged (user will be billed for the full membership on the date that the renewal date – the date that the trial was set to renew to a full membership).

    request.merchantCustomerID = "cust-1";
    request.merchantInvoiceID = "invoice-1";
    request.amount = "1.75";


**Zero dollar upgrade**  
Scenario: User wants to upgrade to a membership that is billed quarterly. The example code below will upgrade the subscription to $200.00 billed quarterly. Change takes effect at renewal date.

    request.merchantCustomerID = "cust-1";
    request.merchantInvoiceID = "invoice-1";
    request.rebillAmount = "200.00";
    request.rebillFrequency = "QUARTERLY";

**Cancel Promo**  
User indicates that he wants to cancel – he is then presented with a promotional membership product (in this example a $100 quarterly product) that induces him to keep his membership active. The example code below will modify his existing subscription to one that is $100 billed quarterly. Change takes effect at renewal date.

    request.merchantCustomerID = "cust-1";
    request.merchantInvoiceID = "invoice-1";
    request.rebillAmount = "100.00";
    request.rebillFrequency = "QUARTERLY";
